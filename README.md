Hello human. Welcome to PURR.
It is not easy to explain what PURR is. You better 
form your own opinion at your own pace.
There is only one thing that purr is not â€“ hate.
We gathered here to PURR after all.

###i. I learn a lot from cats.
I am allergic to cats and it is a big bummer. But 
damn does not this stop me from interacting with these
majestic masters of purr.
Cats mastered a way of life that maximises chill
enjoyment of their own bodies and play. Well, that 
sounds like a good deal to me. So I embark on my 
adventure to understand how we humans can learn to 
chill and enjoy ourselves to the point that we purr.
